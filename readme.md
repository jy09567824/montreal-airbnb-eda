## üîÑ Project Workflow

### 1. Problem Definition
- **Key Questions**:
  - Which neighborhood has the highest potential for success?
  - How should we price our services to stay competitive?
  - Which factors influence booking rates?
  - How can we maximize profit?

### 2. Data Preparation
#### Cleaning Process
- **`listings.csv`**:
  - Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns (e.g., `neighbourhood_group`, `last_review`).
  - Handle missing values and outliers.
  - Example:
    ```python
    df['reviews_per_month'].fillna(0, inplace=True)
    ```
- **`calendar.csv`**:
  - Convert data types (e.g., `price` to numeric, `available` to binary).
  - Remove unnecessary columns (`minimum_nights`, `maximum_nights`).

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Key Findings
- **Revenue by Neighborhood**:
  - Top neighborhoods: `Ville-Marie`, `Le Plateau-Mont-Royal`.
  - Visualization:
    ```python
    sns.barplot(data=revenue_by_neighbourhood, x='neighbourhood', y='revenue')
    plt.title('Total Revenue by Neighbourhood')
    ```
- **Hotel Pricing in Ville-Marie**:
  - Average price: **$278**.
  - Insight: Pricing strategy should reflect high-quality services to justify premium rates.

#### Booking Rate Analysis
- Factors such as license, reviews, and room type show weak correlation with booking rates.
- Key metric: `(365 - availability_365) / 365`.

### 4. Profit Maximization Strategy
- **Time Series Analysis**:
  - Availability rates decrease closer to the booking date.
  - Peak season: **June to August** (validated with Google Trends).
- **Recommendation**:
  - Focus on providing competitive pricing and high-quality services during peak seasons.
